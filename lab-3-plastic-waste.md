## Data

The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file in the `data`
folder of your repository. You can read it in using the following.

``` r
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

**Hint:** If you’re not sure, run the command `?NA` which will lead you
to the documentation.

-   Have a quick look at the data and notice that there are cells taking
    the value `NA` – what does this mean?

# Exercises

Let’s start by taking a look at the distribution of plastic waste per
capita in 2010.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).

One country stands out as an unusual observation at the top of the
distribution. One way of identifying this country is to filter the data
for countries where plastic waste per capita is greater than 3.5
kg/person.

``` r
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 10
    ##   code  entity continent  year gdp_per_cap plastic_waste_p… mismanaged_plas…
    ##   <chr> <chr>  <chr>     <dbl>       <dbl>            <dbl>            <dbl>
    ## 1 TTO   Trini… North Am…  2010      31261.              3.6             0.19
    ## # … with 3 more variables: mismanaged_plastic_waste <dbl>, coastal_pop <dbl>,
    ## #   total_pop <dbl>

Did you expect this result? You might consider doing some research on
Trinidad and Tobago to see why plastic waste per capita is so high
there, or whether this is a data error.

E1. Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita
faceted by continent. What can you say about how the continents compare
to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita?

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
color = continent,
fill = continent)) +
geom_histogram(alpha = 0.7)
```

answer:the africa is the most density continent and the south america is
the most continent in plastic wate per cap

Another way of visualizing numerical data is using density plots.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_density()
```

And compare distributions across continents by colouring density curves
by continent.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

The resulting plot may be a little difficult to read, so let’s also fill
the curves in with colours as well.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

This still doesn’t look great…

E2. Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha
level that works better for displaying the density curves for all
continents.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
color = continent,
fill = continent)) +
geom_density(alpha = 0.4)
```

E3. Describe why we defined the `color` and `fill` of the curves by
mapping aesthetics of the plot but we defined the `alpha` level as a
characteristic of the plotting geom.

Answer here:\`Because here we represent a set of data (continents), not
just color control, as the color here belong to the continents,and also
the filling is related to the continents But the Alpha it’s talking
about all Graphic(geme\_density)

And yet another way to visualize this relationship is using side-by-side
box plots.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

E4. Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to
[violin plots](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html).
What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are
apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_violin()
```

answer: box plots provide a coarser summary of the data, provide more of
a summary of a distribution can also be seen sa an advantage in certain
cases than violin plots. **Remember:** We use `geom_point()` to make
scatterplots.

E5. Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and
mismanaged plastic waste per capita using a scatterplot. Describe the
relationship.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
mapping = aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,
y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
geom_point()
```

Answer: the relationship is positive E6. Colour the points in the
scatterplot by continent. Does there seem to be any clear distinctions
between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and
mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated?

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
mapping = aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,color=continent,fill =continent,
y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
geom_point()
```

Answre:Europe(positive) relationship,Africa is the
most(mismanged\_plastic waste per cap) E7. Visualize the relationship
between plastic waste per capita and total population as well as plastic
waste per capita and coastal population. You will need to make two
separate plots. Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more
strongly linearly associated?

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
       mapping = aes(x = total_pop,color=continent,fill =continent,
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
    geom_point()
```

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
       mapping = aes(x = coastal_pop,color=continent,fill =continent,
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
    geom_point()
```

The answer: Asia has more population but less waste compared to
continents with less population and more waste

# Wrapping up

If you haven’t had time to finish the exercises above, please ask for
help before you leave!

**Hint:** The x-axis is a calculated variable. One country with plastic
waste per capita over 3 kg/day has been filtered out. And the data are
not only represented with points on the plot but also a smooth curve.
The term “smooth” should help you [pick which geom to
use](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-geoms).

E8. Recreate the following plot, and interpret what you see in context
of the data.

![](lab-3-plastic-waste_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
plastic_waste %>% 
  mutate(coastal_pop_prop = coastal_pop / total_pop) %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = coastal_pop_prop, y = plastic_waste_per_cap, color = continent)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(color = "black", method= "glm") +
    scale_color_viridis_d() +
    labs(x = "Coastal population proportion (Coastal / total population)", 
         y = "Plastic waste per capita ", 
         color = "Continent",
         title = "Plastic waste vs. coastal population proportion",
         subtitle = "by continent") +
    theme_minimal()
```

Answer: geme\_smooth (Aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of
overplotting also it’s help us to do see the curve of the data and
analyis it via a different way) Knit, *commit (with an appropriate
message), and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit
message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git
pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to
make sure you’re happy with the final state of your work.*
